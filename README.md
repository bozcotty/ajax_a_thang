# Ajax a Thang

## This is a simple one-page Rails 4.2.0 (beta) app with one resource - a Thang.

You can create, read, update and destroy thangs in this app. Thangs have names and descriptions. Everything about all the thangs can be done on the home page. I've ajaxified the thangs so this is possible.
